# Railway-Management-System


		The Data Structures-based project is designed to solve the problem of finding the shortest path between two stations in a railway network. This project is based on graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. The list of trains and their timings have been stored in two notepad files, and the program reads this information using file handling techniques to process it.

The project also includes a feature to store the information of the passengers by generating a unique PNR and making their ticket. This feature allows the users to book their tickets and travel on the train of their choice easily. The program is designed to handle various scenarios such as multiple trains between the same source and destination, availability of seats, and cancellation of tickets.

The implementation of data structures like graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm helps to improve the efficiency of the program and provides an accurate and faster solution to the problem. This project can be used in real-life scenarios where there is a need to find the shortest path between two stations in a railway network, making it a useful and practical application.

Overall, this project aims to provide a user-friendly interface and efficient solution to the problem of finding the shortest path between two stations in a railway network. It makes use of various data structures and algorithms to provide a reliable and effective solution to the users.
